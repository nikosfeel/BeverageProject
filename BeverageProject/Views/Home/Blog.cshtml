                        <p class="margin-bottom-20 letter-spacing-2 margin-bottom-0">
                            Answering the question "Who invented wine?" isn't really possibly because scientists and historians alike believe wine was not really invented, it was more discovered than anything. Basically, they believe that the discovery of wine was made by ancient peoples when they found their grapes had spoiled and fermented, creating fermented grape juice. Many believe that this is when the wine-making process was invented, and this is where most stories about the origins of wine begin. First, some historical and archaeological facts before delving into myth and fables.                            <ul class="margin-bottom-20 letter-spacing-2">
                                <li class="margin-bottom-20">Scientists have dated fossilized grape seeds at 66 million years old.</li>
                                <li class="margin-bottom-20">Archeologists have discovered evidence of winemaking occurring around 8,000 years ago in Tbilisi, Georgia. They found pottery decorated with fruit, and pollen analysis showed evidence of grape cultivation.</li>
                                <li class="margin-bottom-20">The Hajji Firuz Tepe wine jar, found in modern day Iran, is one of the oldest pieces of archaeological evidence of wine making. The Hajji Firuz Tepe wine jar, along with a wine press, known to be a wine press due to its tartaric crystal and tannin residue, was dated to 6000 B.C.</li>
                                <li class="margin-bottom-20">There were no written records about viticulture or wine making for nearly 5,000 years. The craft of making wine was passed down for generations through families and apprenticeships.</li>
                                <li class="margin-bottom-20">Historians believe that Phoenicians were the ones who spread their wine making knowledge to ancient Greece and Italy.</li>
                                <li class="margin-bottom-20">Christian monks are credited with France's reputation as one of the best wine making countries in the world. It was their meticulous records about grape varietals, terroir, and growing methods that allowed France to perfect and develop its wine making skills.</li>

                        <p class="margin-bottom-20">
                            There are a few well known wine myths and fables that credit different parts of the world for the invention, or discovery, of wine. Here are a few of the more popular stories.

                        <h3 class="margin-bottom-10"> Dionysus</h3>
                        <p>                           
                            This is arguably one of the most well known wine fables. In Greek mythology, Dionysus, son of Zeus and his mistress Semele, invented wine while living in the ancient Mount Nysa amongst nymphs. This is one of the reasons why Dionysus is often referred to as the "God of Wine".
